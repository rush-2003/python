# Given an array arr and a target difference diff, 
# you need to find the number of subsets such that 
# the difference between the sum of elements in two subsets equals diff.

# array_sum_1 = s1
# array_sum_2 = s2

# S1 - S2 = Given Difference -------------- Equation 1
# S1 + S2 = Entire Array Sum -------------- Equation 2
# Adding 1 and 2
# S1 = (Given Difference + Entire Array Sum) / 2

'''
Now the question is
To find the count of subsets with sum S1
Which is -> Count of Subset Problem
